## Syllable Structure

(C signifies Consonant, V signifies Verb, N signifies nasal consonant ([n], [ŋ] or [m]), Round brackets/parentheses — `()` — indicate that what they're enclosing is optional and can thus either be there or not)

* (C)V(N) for the first syllable of any and all morphemes, CV(N) for the rest of syllables
* Stress should always be placed on the 2nd-to-last syllable
