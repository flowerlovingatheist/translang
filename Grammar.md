# Grammar

## Sentence Structure

The sentence structure is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), with postmodifier adjectives and adverbs (adjectives and adverbs are placed after what they describe).

## Nouns

A noun is formed by a root, followed by optional suffixes and an ending.

Ending is either empty or -sa for plural. 

For example kaselusesa is catgirls, which is formed from root kase, suffixes -lu and -se, and ending -sa.

Roots are gender neutral by themselves and only (pro)nouns can have number and gender.

## Verbs

Verb is formed as root followed by ending. 

Ending is either empty, -da for past tense, -ne for present tense, -lo for future tense, or -do for imperative mood.

It can also be postfixed by -ku to indicate uncertainty, for example "Are you sleeping?" could be worded as "?'mida somoneku".
