## Common Misunderstandings

### ni- vs mo- vs -fe

The difference between the affixes ni- , mo- , and -fe may seem confusing for some people. 

#### A general definition is:
* ni- is used for negation, having exactly the same meaning as non- in english, and thus establishes that the word is specifically ***not*** what the rest of it means. It can thus definitively refer to one concrete word (see first example), or be more abstract and refer to a wider array of possible options (see examples two and three). Examples:
  1. nikumi , literal meaning being non-trans, and since the only possibilities in this case are trans and cis, cis
  2. ni[positive] (we don't have words for positive, neutral, and negative), which would literally mean non-positive, and could thus mean negative or neutral
  3. nikase , literal meaning being non-cat, which could mean anything without specific context. **Thus, certain combinations with ni- are impractical and should not be used**.
* mo- is used for inversion, meaning "the contrary/inverse of", and hence establishes that the word is the ***contrary*** of what the rest of it means. It thus always definitively refers to one concrete word, unless there is ambiguity in the interpretation. Examples:
  1. mo[positive] (we don't have words for positive, neutral, and negative), which would literally mean the contrary of positive (negative)
* -fe is used to convey opposition towards something, meaning "opposed to", and thus simply defines opposition towards what the rest of the word means. Examples:
  1. kumife , literal meaning being "opposed to transness", that being "transphobe"
